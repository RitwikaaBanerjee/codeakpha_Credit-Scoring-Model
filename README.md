Loan Eligibility Predictor
This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts loan eligibility using a trained machine learning model. The app collects personal and financial information from users, processes the data through a machine learning model, and determines if the user is eligible for a loan.

Features
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
Accepts personal and financial input such as age, account balance, job type, and loan history
Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict loan eligibility
Displays results in real-time: eligible or not eligible for a loan
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language
Streamlit: Web framework for building the UI
Joblib: For loading the pre-trained model
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
