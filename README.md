# Loan Eligibility Predictor

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts loan eligibility using a trained machine learning model. The app collects personal and financial information from users, processes the data through a machine learning model, and determines if the user is eligible for a loan.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- Accepts personal and financial input such as age, account balance, job type, and loan history
- Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict loan eligibility
- Displays results in real-time: eligible or not eligible for a loan

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building the UI
- **Joblib**: For loading the pre-trained model
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
